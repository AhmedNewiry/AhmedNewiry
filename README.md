I’m Ahmed Abd Al Fattah Abd Al Sattar, a passionate **Full Stack Developer** with experience in building scalable and high-performing web applications. I specialize in **React.js**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **Typescript**, and I also have strong expertise in **Python**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **C Programming**.

I recently completed the **ALX (Holberton School) Software Engineering Program**, a one-year intensive course, and I also hold a **Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree**. Throughout my journey, I have worked on various projects that helped me hone my skills in both frontend and backend development, as well as microservice architectures.

## Xchange Project

One of my key accomplishments is the **Xchange** project, which I built as part of my final project during my ALX journey. **Xchange** is a **microservices-based architecture** that facilitates users in offering and requesting services, making it highly scalable and maintainable. 

The backend of **Xchange** is built using **NestJS**, employing **GraphQL** for communication between services. The project utilizes **Prisma ORM** for database interactions and is designed to be modular, allowing for easy scaling as new services are added.

### Key Features:
- **Microservices architecture**: Xchange is built using a **microservices-based architecture**, making it highly scalable and resilient.
- **GraphQL**: Communication between microservices is managed through **GraphQL** to ensure flexible and efficient data retrieval.
- **Prisma ORM**: The project uses **Prisma ORM** for smooth database integration and easy management of data models.
- **Scalable and maintainable**: The architecture is designed for scalability, enabling easy updates and expansions of new features.
- **Notification Microservice**: The project uses **RabbitMQ** and **GraphQL WebSockets** to implement a **real-time notification microservice**, allowing users to receive updates about their service requests and offers.

Although **Xchange** is a private repository, I have created a **demo video** showcasing the project’s functionality and architecture. You can watch the demo here: [Xchange Project Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14j2itbQoaBz1yn8eVJgmVeKBm_KsHWvJ/view?usp=drivesdk).
