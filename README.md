Hi, Iâ€™m Ahmed! Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with a strong background in both frontend and backend technologies. I graduated from **ALX Africa (Holberton School)** and completed a **Udacity Full Stack Web Development** program, where I developed the skills to design, build, and maintain modern web applications.

I specialize in developing robust, scalable applications using technologies like **Node.js**, **React.js**, **TypeScript**, and **GraphQL**. I also have hands-on experience with **Docker**, **CI/CD pipelines**, and deploying cloud-based applications. Additionally, I am proficient in **Python**, **SQLAlchemy**, and **C programming language**, which allow me to tackle a wide range of software engineering challenges.

## Key Highlights:
- **Final Project: Xchange** â€“ A full-stack platform for users to request and offer services, built during my time at ALX and Udacity. While the repository is private, you can watch a **demo video** of the project here: [Xchange Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14j2itbQoaBz1yn8eVJgmVeKBm_KsHWvJ/view?usp=drivesdk).  
- Expertise in managing databases with **SQL**, **Prisma ORM**, and **NoSQL** technologies.  
- Solid experience with **DevOps**, including server configuration, **NGINX**, **load balancing**, and **AWS**.  
- Passion for optimizing code for performance and scalability in both **microservices** and **monolithic** architectures.

Iâ€™m constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest in web development technologies.
